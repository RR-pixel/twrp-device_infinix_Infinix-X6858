## Port status

This tree is ported from the X6886 TWRP tree and uses the stock X6855
payload for kernel modules and firmware. The build is verified; hardware
validation on an X6855 is still required.

Expected recovery features to validate:

- Recovery boot
- Touchscreen
- Vibration
- USB OTG, including hotplug
- FBE decryption
- Battery and charging status
- ADB and ADB sideload
- Fastbootd and A/B slot switching
- Normal Android boot alongside TWRP

## Reporting issues

Please include your firmware and kernel versions, the recovery build you
used, and steps to reproduce the problem.

Use **Advanced → Export logs** to save recovery logs. Review them for
personal information before sharing.

## Development

This tree uses the [TWRP-Test manifest](https://github.com/TWRP-Test/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp)
(`twrp-16.0` branch), not the official TeamWin minimal manifest.

Shared device support is maintained in the MT6789 common tree
(`device/transsion/mt6789-common`, branch `twrp-16.0-tos16`). Build
instructions and porting notes are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
